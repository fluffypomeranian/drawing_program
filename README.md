# drawing_program
A simple computer graphics drawing program that uses Java Swing for the GUI. The program allows users to create several kinds of shapes (such as Circles, Ovals, Rectangles and general Polygons) on the drawing canvas, select them by clicking on them with the mouse, and then move them around the canvas and rotate them. There is also a option to draw free‚Äêform strokes by dragging the mouse (the body of the whale in the image below was drawn using a "FreeDraw" mode). The user can undo each operation and you can save and reload the drawings using a given format.
